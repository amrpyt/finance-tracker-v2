## Performance Analysis

### Response Time Breakdown

```
Test                          | Response Time | Target    | Performance
------------------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------
/start (first call)          | 175ms         | < 2000ms  | 91.2% faster
/help (first call)           | 175ms         | < 1000ms  | 82.5% faster
/start (registry test)       | 175ms         | < 2000ms  | 91.2% faster
/help (registry test)        | 153ms         | < 1000ms  | 84.7% faster
Concurrent (3 requests)      | 320ms total   | < 500ms   | 107ms avg each
```

**Average Response Time:** 170ms  
**Target:** < 1500ms (average of all targets)  
**Performance:** **88.7% faster than target** üöÄ

### Performance Highlights

1. **Consistently Fast:** All tests under 200ms
2. **Well Under Targets:** Even most aggressive target (< 1000ms for /help) exceeded by 82%+
3. **Concurrent Performance:** No degradation under concurrent load
4. **Refactoring Impact:** Zero - performance maintained after command router refactoring
