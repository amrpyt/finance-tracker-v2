| Epic | Story | ID  | Title | File |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ----- | ---- |
| 3 | 4 | 3.4 | Auto-Categorization | `docs/stories/story-3.4.md` |
| 3 | 5 | 3.5 | Transaction Storage | `docs/stories/story-3.5.md` |
| 3 | 6 | 3.6 | Typing Indicators | `docs/stories/story-3.6.md` |
| 3 | 7 | 3.7 | Status Messages | `docs/stories/story-3.7.md` |
| 3 | 8 | 3.8 | Emoji Reactions | `docs/stories/story-3.8.md` |

| 4 | 4 | 4.4 | Edit/Cancel Loan | `docs/stories/story-4.4.md` |
| 4 | 5 | 4.5 | Loan Reminders | `docs/stories/story-4.5.md` |

**Total in backlog:** 10 stories (Epic 3-4 only, Epic 5-10 stories not yet drafted)

**Instructions:**

- Stories move from BACKLOG → TODO when previous story is complete
- SM agent uses story information from this table to draft new stories
- Story order is sequential (Epic 1 stories first, then Epic 2, etc.)

#### TODO (Ready for Implementation)

- **Story ID:** 3.4
- **Story Title:** Auto-Categorization
- **Story File:** `docs/stories/story-3.4.md`
- **Status:** Not Yet Drafted
- **Context File:** Not yet created
- **Action:** SM should run create-story workflow to draft this story

**Instructions:**

- Only ONE story in TODO at a time
- Story stays in TODO until it moves to IN PROGRESS
- Next story is Story 3.2 from Epic 3 backlog
- Tech Debt story TD-001 can be prioritized by user if needed

#### IN PROGRESS (Approved for Development)

- **Story ID:** 3.3
- **Story Title:** Confirmation Workflow
- **Story File:** `docs/stories/story-3.3.md`
- **Story Status:** Not Yet Drafted
- **Context File:** Not yet created
- **Action:** SM should run create-story workflow to draft this story, then story-ready to approve for development

**Instructions:**

- Only ONE story in IN PROGRESS at a time
- Story stays here until user marks it "approved" (DoD complete)
- DEV reads this section to know which story to implement
- After DEV completes story, user reviews and runs `story-approved` workflow

#### DONE (Completed Stories)

| Story ID | File | Completed Date | Points |
| -------- | ---- | -------------- | ------ |
| 1.1 | `docs/stories/story-1.1.md` | 2025-10-13 | 8 |
| 1.2 | `docs/stories/story-1.2.md` | 2025-10-13 | 5 |
| 1.3 | `docs/stories/story-1.3.md` | 2025-10-13 | 8 |
| 1.4 | `docs/stories/story-1.4.md` | 2025-10-13 | 5 |
| 2.1 | `docs/stories/story-2.1.md` | 2025-10-15 | 13 |
| 2.2 | `docs/stories/story-2.2.md` | 2025-10-15 | 5 |
| 2.3 | `docs/stories/story-2.3.md` | 2025-10-16 | 13 |

| 3.2 | `docs/stories/story-3.2.md` | 2025-10-19 | 21 |

**Total completed:** 11 stories  
**Total points completed:** 133 points

**Instructions:**

- Stories move here when user runs `story-approved` workflow (DEV agent)
- Immutable record of completed work
- Used for velocity tracking and progress reporting

#### Epic/Story Summary

**Total Epics:** 11 (10 main + 1 sub-epic)  
**Total Stories:** ~50 stories (estimated)  
**Stories in Backlog:** 10 (Epic 3-4 drafted, plus TD-001 tech debt)  
**Stories in TODO:** 1 (Story 3.4 - needs drafting)  
**Stories in IN PROGRESS:** 1 (Story 3.3 - needs drafting)  
**Stories DONE:** 11

**Epic Breakdown:**

- Epic 1: Foundation & Telegram Bot Setup (4/4 stories complete) ✅
- Epic 2: Account Management (5/5 stories complete) ✅
- Epic 3: Expense & Income Logging with AI + UX Polish (2/9 stories complete)
- Epic 4: Loan Tracking System (0/5 stories complete)
- Epic 5: Transaction History & Search (0/4 stories complete)
- Epic 6: Budget Planning & Tracking (0/6 stories complete)
- Epic 7: Savings Goals & Progress Tracking (0/5 stories complete)
- Epic 7.5: Gamification & Milestones (0/3 stories complete)
- Epic 8: Recurring Transactions & Automation (0/3 stories complete)
- Epic 9: Bill Reminders & Notifications (0/5 stories complete)
- Epic 10: Advanced Analytics & Insights (0/5 stories complete)

#### State Transition Logic

**Story Lifecycle:**

```
BACKLOG → TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE
```

**Transition Rules:**

1. **BACKLOG → TODO**: Automatically when previous story moves TODO → IN PROGRESS
2. **TODO → IN PROGRESS**: User runs SM agent `story-ready` workflow after reviewing drafted story
3. **IN PROGRESS → DONE**: User runs DEV agent `story-approved` workflow after DoD complete

**Important:**

- SM agent NEVER searches for "next story" - always reads TODO section
- DEV agent NEVER searches for "current story" - always reads IN PROGRESS section
- Both agents update this status file after their workflows complete

- Decision: Implement full conversational AI for all user interactions
- Rationale: Natural, intuitive UX; reduces learning curve; bilingual support
- Impact: All features use natural language, not just transactions

**ADR-003: Conversation Context Retention** (2025-10-16)
- Decision: Implement conversation context retention for multi-turn interactions
- Rationale: Enable complex workflows, reduce repetition, improve UX
- Impact: System remembers context across messages for better conversation flow
