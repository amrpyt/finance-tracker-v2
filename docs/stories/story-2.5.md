# Story 2.5: Delete Account

Status: Complete

## Story

As a registered user with one or more accounts,
I want to delete or archive unused accounts using natural language commands like "احذف حساب المحفظة" or "delete my bank account",
so that I can keep my account list clean and organized while preserving transaction history for record-keeping and data integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Intent Detection** - AI parser (RORK) detects "delete_account" intent from natural language with 85%+ confidence from commands like "احذف الحساب", "delete account", "remove account", "امسح الحساب"
2. **AC2: Account Selection** - If user has multiple accounts, displays numbered list with account details (emoji, name, type, balance, transaction count) for user to select which account to delete
3. **AC3: Bilingual Support** - Accepts both Arabic ("احذف حساب البنك", "امسح المحفظة") and English ("delete bank account", "remove wallet") inputs with equivalent accuracy
4. **AC4: Soft Delete Strategy** - Implements soft delete (isDeleted=true) rather than hard delete to preserve referential integrity; deleted accounts remain in database but hidden from user views
5. **AC5: Transaction Preservation** - All transactions linked to deleted account remain in database with full history intact; transactions are NOT deleted or orphaned
6. **AC6: Balance Warning** - If account has non-zero balance, shows warning: "⚠️ هذا الحساب لديه رصيد [balance] [currency]. هل تريد المتابعة؟" with confirmation required
7. **AC7: Transaction Count Warning** - Shows transaction count in confirmation: "هذا الحساب لديه [count] معاملة. سيتم الاحتفاظ بسجل المعاملات للرجوع إليها." to inform user that history is preserved
8. **AC8: Default Account Protection** - If attempting to delete the default account, shows warning: "⚠️ هذا هو حسابك الافتراضي. يجب تعيين حساب افتراضي آخر أولاً" and prevents deletion until another account is set as default
9. **AC9: Last Account Protection** - If user has only one account, prevents deletion with message: "❌ لا يمكن حذف آخر حساب. يجب أن يكون لديك حساب واحد على الأقل" to ensure user always has at least one active account
10. **AC10: Confirmation Workflow** - Before deletion, displays detailed confirmation message showing: account name, type, balance, transaction count, and consequences with inline keyboard: "تأكيد الحذف 🗑️" / "إلغاء ❌"
11. **AC11: Success Response** - Sends confirmation: "✅ تم حذف الحساب بنجاح!\n🗑️ الحساب المحذوف: [name] ([type])\n📝 تم الاحتفاظ بسجل [count] معاملة للرجوع إليها" and displays updated accounts overview (excluding deleted account)
12. **AC12: View Filter** - Deleted accounts excluded from all account lists (view accounts, account selection menus, balance calculations) but remain queryable for transaction history
13. **AC13: Balance Recalculation** - After deletion, total balance calculations exclude deleted account; individual account balances remain unchanged for historical accuracy
14. **AC14: Transaction History Access** - Users can still view transaction history that includes deleted accounts; transactions show account name with "(محذوف)" indicator
15. **AC15: No Cascade Delete** - Deletion does NOT cascade to related entities (transactions, budgets, goals); only the account record is marked as deleted
16. **AC16: Audit Trail** - Updates deletedAt timestamp and isDeleted flag; maintains createdAt and updatedAt for audit purposes
17. **AC17: Message History** - Stores all messages (user request, account selection, confirmation, success) in messages table with intent and entities
18. **AC18: Fallback Regex** - If RORK API fails, falls back to regex patterns for Arabic/English delete account commands
19. **AC19: Performance** - Complete delete flow (message → AI parsing → selection → confirmation → soft delete → response) in < 4 seconds
20. **AC20: Cancel Anytime** - User can cancel at any step (account selection, confirmation) with "إلغاء" button or message; no changes made until final confirmation

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

**Soft Delete Pattern:**
- Implements soft delete (isDeleted flag) to preserve referential integrity
- Deleted accounts remain in database but filtered from all user-facing queries
- Transaction history remains fully accessible with deleted account indicator
- Follows industry best practice for financial data (never hard delete)

**Multi-Layer Validation:**
- Pre-deletion validation (Task 3) runs before confirmation to catch issues early
- Mutation-level validation ensures data integrity at database layer
- UI-level checks provide immediate feedback without server round-trip

**Transaction Preservation:**
- Zero cascade delete - transactions are sacred and never deleted
- Account deletion only affects account visibility, not transaction data
- Historical accuracy maintained for audit and compliance purposes

### Source Tree Components

**New Files:**
```
convex/
  commands/
    deleteAccountCommand.ts          # Main command handler
  lib/
    validateAccountDeletion.ts       # Pre-deletion validation logic
    deleteAccountConfirmation.ts     # Confirmation message builder
  accounts/
    softDelete.ts                    # Soft delete mutation
```

**Modified Files:**
```
convex/
  schema.ts                          # Add isDeleted, deletedAt fields
  telegram/webhook.ts                # Add delete callbacks
  accounts/list.ts                   # Filter deleted accounts
  accounts/getTotalBalance.ts        # Exclude deleted from balance
  lib/transactionFormatter.ts        # Show deleted indicator
  lib/responseHelpers.ts             # Add delete success handler
  ai/nlParser.ts                     # Add delete_account intent
  lib/regexFallback.ts               # Add delete patterns
  commands/helpCommand.ts            # Document delete feature
```

### Testing Standards

**Critical Test Cases:**
1. Soft delete marks account as deleted without removing from database
2. Last account protection prevents deletion of only remaining account
3. Default account protection prevents deletion until another default is set
4. Transaction preservation verified - all transactions remain accessible
5. Balance calculations exclude deleted accounts
6. Transaction history shows deleted account indicator
7. Deleted accounts filtered from all account lists and selection menus
8. Cancel flow leaves no side effects
9. Concurrent deletion attempts handled safely
10. Error messages are clear and actionable in both languages

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Full delete flow (intent detection → confirmation → deletion → response): < 4 seconds
- Account list query with deleted filter: < 500ms
- Transaction count query: < 300ms
- Soft delete mutation: < 200ms

### Project Structure Notes

**Database Schema Changes:**
- Adding `isDeleted` and `deletedAt` fields to accounts table
- New index `by_user_active` for efficient filtering of active accounts
- Backward compatible: existing accounts without isDeleted treated as active

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Command handler follows established pattern from Story 2.3 (Edit Account)
- Reuses `accountSelector.ts` utility for consistent account selection UX
- Follows soft delete pattern used in other entities (transactions have soft delete too)
- Confirmation workflow matches established UX patterns

**Detected Conflicts/Variances:**
- None - follows existing patterns and conventions
- Soft delete strategy aligns with financial data best practices
- Validation approach consistent with other account operations

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Soft Delete Over Hard Delete** - Preserves referential integrity and transaction history
2. **Last Account Protection** - Ensures users always have at least one active account
3. **Default Account Protection** - Prevents accidental deletion of default account
4. **Transaction Preservation** - Never cascade delete to maintain financial records
5. **Deleted Account Indicator** - Shows "(محذوف)" in transaction history for transparency

**Integration Points:**
- `convex/ai/nlParser.ts` - Add delete_account intent detection
- `convex/telegram/webhook.ts` - Handle delete callbacks and confirmation flow
- `convex/accounts/list.ts` - Filter deleted accounts from all queries
- `convex/lib/accountSelector.ts` - Reuse for account selection UI
- `convex/lib/responseHelpers.ts` - Add delete success response formatter

## Production Hotfix - 2025-10-17 (19:00-19:27 UTC+3)

**Issue Identified:** Delete account feature was non-functional in production despite passing all tests. User reported "nothing happens" when attempting to delete accounts via natural language or button UI.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

**Bug #1: Missing AI Intent Routing**
- **Location:** `convex/telegram/webhook.ts` line ~1618
- **Cause:** `delete_account` intent was correctly detected by AI parser but webhook had no routing handler
- **Impact:** Delete requests fell through to "unknown intent" handler, generating conversational response instead of executing delete
- **Fix:** Added delete_account intent routing with handler instantiation

**Bug #2: Missing UI Delete Button**
- **Location:** `convex/lib/keyboards.ts` line 179
- **Cause:** Accounts overview keyboard only had 3 buttons (Add/Edit/Refresh), no Delete button
- **Impact:** Feature undiscoverable via UI, only accessible via natural language
- **Fix:** Added 🗑️ Delete button, converted to 2x2 grid layout

**Bug #3: Missing Delete Button Callback Handler**  
- **Location:** `convex/telegram/webhook.ts` line 545
- **Cause:** No webhook handler for `delete_account_select` callback data
- **Impact:** Clicking delete button had no effect
- **Fix:** Added complete callback handler with account selection flow

**Bug #4: Silent Validation Error Handling**
- **Location:** `convex/telegram/webhook.ts` line 1207
- **Cause:** Generic error message shown instead of specific validation errors
- **Impact:** Users saw "Error deleting account" instead of "Cannot delete default account"
- **Fix:** Updated error handler to use `getValidationErrorMessage()` for specific errors

**Bug #5: Context Mismatch in Validation**
- **Location:** `convex/telegram/webhook.ts` line 1135
- **Cause:** `validateAccountDeletion()` called directly from HTTP action context, requires database context
- **Impact:** Runtime error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')"
- **Fix:** Rewrote validation to use `ctx.runQuery()` for database access from action context

**Files Modified:**
- `convex/telegram/webhook.ts` (+70 lines) - Added delete intent routing, button handler, inline validation
- `convex/lib/keyboards.ts` (+10 lines) - Added delete button, 2x2 grid layout

**Deployment:**
- Dev deployment: `https://terrific-ocelot-625.convex.cloud` (tested, verified working)
- Production deployment: `https://giant-mouse-652.convex.cloud` (deployed 2025-10-17 19:27 UTC+3)
- Webhook updated to production endpoint

**Verification:**
- ✅ Natural language delete: "امسح حساب الراجحي" works correctly
- ✅ Button delete: 🗑️ Delete button in accounts overview works
- ✅ Account selection: Clicking accounts shows proper confirmation
- ✅ Validation errors: Attempting to delete default account shows: "⚠️ هذا هو حسابك الافتراضي. يجب تعيين حساب افتراضي آخر أولاً"
- ✅ Successful deletion: Non-default accounts delete with proper success message
- ✅ Transaction preservation: Soft delete maintains all transaction history

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Integration Testing Gap:** Story tests passed but integration between AI routing and webhook handlers was not tested end-to-end
2. **Feature Registration Checklist:** New commands must be registered in: command registry, AI intent routing, UI keyboards, webhook callbacks
3. **Context Awareness:** Validation logic must account for execution context (query/mutation vs action)
4. **Error Message Specificity:** Generic errors hide actionable information; always surface specific validation errors

**Status:** Hotfix deployed and verified in production ✅
