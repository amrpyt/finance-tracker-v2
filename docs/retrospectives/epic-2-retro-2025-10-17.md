**What Went Well:**
- Story Context XML excellence
- Test coverage 315% growth (27→112)
- Bilingual implementation perfect
- Story 2.5 hotfix in 27 minutes

**What Could Improve:**
- Integration testing gap critical
- Production validation before "complete"

**Lessons:** Unit+integration≠production ready; feature registration checklist needed

---

### Murat (TEA) 🧪

**What Went Well:**
- 112 tests with no cheating
- Performance validated
- Tests caught edge cases

**What Could Improve:**
- Integration tests critical gap
- E2E automation underutilized

**Lessons:** All test layers essential (unit+integration+E2E+prod smoke)

---

### Sally (UX Expert) 🎨

**What Went Well:**
- Conversational AI transformed UX
- Natural language + UI buttons
- Visual indicators (⭐🗑️ emoji)

**What Could Improve:**

## Epic 3 Preview: Expense & Income Logging

**Goals:** Natural language transactions, 85%+ AI accuracy, UX polish

**9 Stories:**
1. AI Expense Logging
2. AI Income Logging  
3. Confirmation Workflow
4. Auto-Categorization
5. Transaction Storage
6-9. UX Enhancements (typing, status, reactions, variations)

**Dependencies:** ✅ All Epic 2 prerequisites met

**Preparation Needed:**
- Integration test framework (HIGH - 3h)
- Category taxonomy (REQUIRED - 1h)
- Transaction AI prompts (2h)
- UX patterns (1h)

---

## Action Items

### Process Improvements
1. **Production Validation in DoD** - Mandatory before "complete" (Bob+Murat, 1h)
2. **Feature Registration Checklist** - AI+handler+routing+UI+callbacks (Amelia, 30min)

### Technical Debt
1. **Integration Test Framework** - HIGH priority for Epic 3 (Murat+Amelia, 3h)
2. **Fix viewAccountsCommand Tests** - 3 failing tests (Amelia, 1h)
3. **Centralized Error Mapping** - MEDIUM priority (Winston+Amelia, 2h)

---

## Preparation Sprint (1 day, 9 hours)

- [ ] Integration test framework (3h) - CRITICAL
- [ ] Category taxonomy (1h) - REQUIRED
- [ ] Transaction AI prompts (2h)
- [ ] UX enhancement patterns (1h)
- [ ] Fix test failures (1h)
- [ ] Write Epic 3 stories (1h)

## Critical Path for Epic 3

**Blockers:**
1. ✋ Integration test framework (prevents Story 2.5-style bugs)
2. ✋ Category taxonomy (required for auto-categorization)
3. ✋ Feature registration checklist (prevents integration gaps)

---

## Verification Results

**Testing:** ✅ 112/119 passing (94%), ⚠️ integration gap  
**Deployment:** ✅ Production stable  
**Business:** ✅ All stories approved  
**Technical Health:** ✅ Good (minor test debt)  
**Blockers:** ⚠️ 1 blocking for Epic 3 (integration tests)

---

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Prep sprint ROI proven** - RORK+command router enabled zero rework
2. **Production validation essential** - Tests passing ≠ production working
3. **Integration testing critical** - Unit tests don't catch integration bugs
4. **Conversational AI exceeds expectations** - ADR-002 major UX win
5. **Feature registration checklist needed** - Systematic prevents missing pieces

---

## Team Agreements

1. Production validation mandatory in DoD
2. Feature registration checklist for all commands
3. Integration tests required for multi-component features
4. Conversational AI + UI buttons standard
5. Soft delete pattern for all entity deletions

---

## Architectural Decisions

**ADR-001:** RORK AI over regex - Zero rework across 5 stories  
**ADR-002:** Full conversational AI - Exceeded PRD expectations  
**ADR-003:** Conversation context retention - Enables complex flows

---

## Closing - Bob (Scrum Master)

Epic 2: Complete success! 5/5 stories, 112 tests, conversational AI innovation, valuable lessons from Story 2.5.

Epic 3: Ready after 1-day prep sprint. One blocking issue (integration tests), clear path forward.

Key takeaway: Production validation and integration testing are non-negotiable for quality.
