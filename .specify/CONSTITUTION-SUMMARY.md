# Finance Tracker V2 Constitution - Summary

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Ratified**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: âœ… Active

## What Changed

### Constitution Created
- **Initial version**: 1.0.0
- **8 Core Principles** defined and enforced
- **24 Quality Gates** established across development lifecycle
- **Architecture Standards** locked for consistency
- **Governance Process** documented

### Templates Updated
- âœ… `plan-template.md` - Added Finance Tracker V2 specific constitution checks and technical context
- âœ… `spec-template.md` - Already aligned with constitution requirements
- âœ… `tasks-template.md` - Already aligned with constitution requirements

## Core Principles (Quick Reference)

### I. Feature-Based Organization (BMAD Pattern)
- All code in `/bmad` folder
- Features in `/bmad/features/[feature-name]/`
- Shared components in `/bmad/components/`

### II. Real-Time First Architecture
- Use `useQuery` for all data fetching
- Use `useMutation` for all writes
- Optimistic updates mandatory
- NO REST polling

### III. Type Safety & Validation
- TypeScript strict mode
- Zod schemas for all inputs
- Zero TypeScript errors policy

### IV. Component Composition & UI Standards
- shadcn/ui components only
- React Hook Form for forms
- Tailwind utility-first
- Lucide icons

### V. Testing Discipline
- Playwright E2E tests for critical flows
- Tests in `/tests` folder
- CI/CD gate - tests must pass

### VI. Code Quality & Standards
- Conventional commits
- Husky pre-commit hooks
- ESLint zero warnings
- No console.log in production

### VII. Database Schema & API Design
- Schema in `/convex/schema.ts`
- Mutations for writes
- Queries for reads
- Zod validation at API boundary

### VIII. Performance & Security Requirements
- < 2s page load
- < 1s transaction lists
- < 500ms mutations
- Clerk auth + userId isolation

## Quality Gates Summary

### Pre-Implementation (5 gates)
Must pass before starting work

### During Implementation (8 gates)
Must maintain throughout development

### Pre-Merge (7 gates)
Must pass before merging to main

### Post-Deployment (4 gates)
Must verify after deployment

**Total**: 24 quality gates

## How to Use This Constitution

### For New Features
1. Run `/speckit.specify` to create feature spec
2. Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
3. Check constitution compliance in plan.md
4. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate tasks
5. Implement following BMAD pattern
6. Verify all quality gates pass

### For Code Reviews
1. Verify constitutional compliance
2. Check all quality gates passed
3. Ensure no violations (or justified in Complexity Tracking)
4. Approve only if compliant

### For Exceptions
1. Document in ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
2. Justify why compliant approach insufficient
3. Set time-box for bringing into compliance
4. Review in quarterly audit

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Constitution created and ratified
2. âœ… Templates updated with Finance Tracker V2 specifics
3. ðŸ“‹ **TODO**: Create first feature using `/speckit.specify` workflow
4. ðŸ“‹ **TODO**: Verify constitution gates work in practice
5. ðŸ“‹ **TODO**: Schedule quarterly compliance audit
