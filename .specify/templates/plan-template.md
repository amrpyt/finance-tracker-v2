# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.7.2 (Strict Mode)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15.1.6, Convex 1.18.2, Clerk 6.11.1, React Hook Form, Zod  
**Storage**: Convex (Real-time BaaS with serverless functions)  
**Testing**: Playwright 1.49.1 (E2E), Jest (unit tests if needed)  
**Target Platform**: Web (Vercel deployment)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js App Router + Convex backend)  
**Performance Goals**: < 2s page load, < 1s transaction lists, < 500ms mutations, < 100ms real-time sync  
**Constraints**: Real-time first (no REST polling), TypeScript strict mode, 10,000+ transactions per user  
**Scale/Scope**: Production application (v2.0.0), multi-user with real-time sync

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Pre-Implementation Gates (Finance Tracker V2)

- [ ] Feature spec reviewed and approved
- [ ] Technical plan documented in this file
- [ ] No constitutional violations (or justified in Complexity Tracking below)
- [ ] Integration points identified and documented
- [ ] Convex schema changes reviewed (if applicable)

### Architecture Compliance

- [ ] Feature follows BMAD pattern (`/bmad/features/[feature-name]/`)
- [ ] Uses Convex real-time subscriptions (no REST polling)
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [ ] Zod schemas for all inputs
- [ ] shadcn/ui components used (no custom reimplementations)
- [ ] React Hook Form for all forms
- [ ] Playwright E2E tests planned
- [ ] Performance targets defined (< 2s page load, < 1s lists, < 500ms mutations)
- [ ] Security requirements met (Clerk auth, userId isolation, input validation)

**Structure Decision**: Finance Tracker V2 uses BMAD (Build-Measure-Analyze-Deploy) pattern with feature-based organization. All frontend code in `/bmad`, all backend functions in `/convex`, all tests in `/tests`.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
